## üöÄ Quickstart

### Prerequisites

* Python **3.11+**
* API keys for your chosen model & search/news providers (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `TAVILY_API_KEY` or similar)
* A vector DB (local **Chroma** by default; Pinecone/Weaviate/Milvus supported via env)

### Installation

```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/<you>/startup-intelligence-agent.git
cd startup-intelligence-agent

# create env
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # (Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate)

# install
pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure environment

Create `.env` in repo root:

```dotenv
# LLMs
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...

# Search / news (pick your stack)
TAVILY_API_KEY=...
NEWS_API_KEY=...

# Storage
VECTOR_DB=chroma
VECTOR_DB_DIR=.cache/chroma
GRAPH_DB_URL=bolt://localhost:7687   # if using Neo4j (optional)

```

## üîí Grounding, QA & Governance

* **Provenance first**: every key claim links to source URL + extraction time.
* **Verification node**: re‚Äëqueries KB & external APIs; below‚Äëthreshold facts are flagged.
* **Confidence model**: combines extraction confidence and source reliability.
* **Compliance**: respect robots.txt & site ToS; prefer official/licensed APIs; store PII securely.
